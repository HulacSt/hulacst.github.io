Sometimes I want to turn markdown into formatted text for an e-mail. At work on Windows, this is a bit more difficult than at home on my mac. 

# Goal
Get contents of a .md file into my clipboard as rich text that I can paste straight into outlook.

## Example .md

```{md}
# Header

Body 1

## Subheader

Here's another body thing.

### Third Header

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| dta 1    | dta 2    |

Some body text

>Quoted text

In the middle of a sentence I'll insert `some code like this`.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT
some_column
,another_column
FROM A.SQL.Table
\`\`\`

```

```{r}
#| eval: false
readr::write_file(md, 'example.md')


# Markdown text to clipboard as HTML to paste into Outlook, etc
md_to_clipboard <- function(input_md) {
  in_path <- tempfile(fileext = '.md')
  readr::write_lines(input, in_path)

  tf2 <- tempfile(fileext = '.html')
  glue::glue('powershell "pandoc {in_path} -t html --ascii | Set-Clipboard -AsHtml"') |>
    system() -> status
  unlink(in_path)
  invisible(status)
};
md_to_clipboard(md) 
```

`-t` 


`-ascii`
